This project is a homebridge plugin for the Dyson air purifiers. Supported devices are:

- 2018 Dyson Pure Cool Tower (TP04)
- 2018 Dyson Pure Cool Desk (DP04)
- Dyson Pure Cool Link Tower (TP02)
- Dyson Pure Cool Link Desk (DP01)

If your device is not supported, please open an issue, I'll try to add support for it.

The device information is downloaded from your Dyson account. You just have to provide the IP addresses of the devices in the local network.

All your devices are exposed as air purifiers in HomeKit, with support (also in Apple Home app) for:
- On/off
- Auto/manual
- Fan speed
- Oscillation on/off
- Relative humidity
- Current temperature (in Apple Home app only supported as separate sensor)
- Air quality (incl. PM2.5, PM10, VOC and NO2 data for 2018 devices)

Optionally, the following switches are exposed:
- Night mode (on/off)
- Jet Focus (on/off for 2018 devices)

The plugin is optimized for usage of the Home app in iOS 13, e.g. the night mode and jet focus switches are combined in a separate settings accessory.
